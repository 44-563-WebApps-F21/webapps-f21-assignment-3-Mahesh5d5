    <h3>Short notes on Combinatorics</h3>
    <p>Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures. It is closely related to many other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from logic to statistical physics, from evolutionary biology to computer science, etc.
       The full scope of combinatorics is not universally agreed upon.According to H.J. Ryser, a definition of the subject is difficult because it crosses so many mathematical subdivisions.Insofar as an area can be described by the types of problems it addresses, combinatorics is involved with:
       the enumeration (counting) of specified structures, sometimes referred to as arrangements or configurations in a very general sense, associated with finite systems,
       the existence of such structures that satisfy certain given criteria,</p>
